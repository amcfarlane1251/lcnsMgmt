## Snipe-IT - Asset Management For the Rest of Us

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/snipe/snipe-it?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is a FOSS project for asset management in IT Operations. Knowing who has which laptop, when it was purchased in order to depreciate it correctly, handling software licenses, etc.

It is built on [Laravel 4.2](http://laravel.com) and uses the [Sentry 2](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry) package.

This project is being actively developed and we're [releasing quite frequently](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/releases). ([Check out the live demo here](http://snipeitapp.com/demo/).)

__This is web-based software__. This means there there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must be run on a web server and accessed through a web browser. It runs on any Mac OSX, flavor of Linux, as well as Windows.

## Important Notes on Updating

Whenever you pull down a new version from master or develop, when you grab the [latest official release](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/releases), make sure to run the following commands via command line:

	php composer.phar dump-autoload
	php artisan migrate

Forgetting to do this can mean your DB might end up out of sync with the new files you just pulled, or you may have some funky cached autoloader values. It's a good idea to get into the habit of running these every time you pull anything new down. If there are no database changes to migrate, it won't hurt anything to run migrations anyway.
